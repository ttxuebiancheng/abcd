### 1. Do you prefer to spend or save? Why?

#### 您喜欢花钱还是存钱？为什么？

I think I should like to save money, because saving money not only allows you to do more things, but also allows you to better plan your current life. When you want something, the money you save can be used, and then help you achieve this goal. Saving money is not only a plan for the future, but also a self-discipline for the present. Our ability to save money shows that we can plan better in our current life. All in all, I think I prefer to save.

### 2. Do you think it’s a good idea to date someone at college? Why or why not?

#### 你认为在大学里和某人约会是个好主意吗？为什么或为什么不呢？

I think it's a good idea to date someone in college. The reasons are as follows. First of all, dating someone in college can improve our ability in this field and pave the way for the future. Secondly, we can constantly(不断地) improve ourselves and enhance(完善) ourselves in this process, so that our ability  can be improved. Dating someone is not only an exercise in IQ, but also an exercise in EQ(情商). It's very important for us to improve one's EQ, so I think it's a good idea to date someone in college.

### 3. How can young people cope with this difficult time period-the odyssey years?

#### 年轻人如何应对这个艰难的时期——奥德赛岁月(二十几岁三十出头的年轻人)？

I think in this period, people can better think about the direction of life. And then define the path(道路) of life. It is precisely(恰恰；正是) because of the difficulties of this period that we can do something to improve ourselves in this period, and then avoid being affected by this event. Everyone has this difficult period. What we have to face is to go through the past and overcome it. After we overcome this period, our personal value and life will be sublimated(升华), so we should deal with this difficult period with a good attitude and do something to improve ourselves in this period.

### 4. What do you think cause the differences in behavior and communication styles between men and women?

#### 您认为是什么导致了 男女行为和沟通方式的差异？

I think the difference in behavior and communication between men and women is essentially due to their different needs, different pursuits(追求) and different environments. Therefore(因此), behavior and communication methods are naturally viewed from their own perspective(角度), so it is inevitable(不可避免的) that there will be differences between men and women in their way of handling things(做事的方式) and attitudes. I think that this difference is really the main reason for the differences in their behavior and communication methods.

### 5. Will you choose to work part-time during college years? Why or why not?

#### 大学期间会选择兼职吗？为什么或为什么不呢？

I will choose a part-time job in the university for the following reasons. First of all, I think that work part-time during college years can not only enrich our lives, but also make us money. We can use this money to do things we like and buy something we like. Secondly, I think part-time job in college is a test of us . It can make our life more orderly(有序的). Finally, I think part-time job in college can lay a foundation for our future life. In future work, we have part-time experience in college, so we can avoid falling into some unnecessary pits. All in all, I will choose to work part-time during college years.

### 6. Do you agree that “Heroism is latent in every human soul”? Why or why not?

#### 同意 “英雄主义潜伏在每个人的灵魂中”这个观点吗？为什么或为什么不呢？

I agree that “Heroism is latent in every human soul”. In my opinion, everyone has the ability to be a hero. No matter how big or small, everyone can become a hero. Being a hero doesn't mean you have to have the ability to change the world. In the depth of everyone's soul, there is a heart to become a hero. Everyone wants to be a hero, but as time goes by, this idea will be affected by some external factors(外界因素), leading to the gradual disappearance of this idea. When something inspires this idea, heroism will be revealed(显露) in a person. So I think this view is correct. That's my reason.

### 7. What are the differences between American and Chinese heroism?

#### 美国英雄主义和中国英雄主义有什么区别？

I have the following views on the differences between Chinese heroism and American heroism. First of all, American heroism tends to individualism(个人主义), emphasizing self and personal values(强调自我和个人和价值观). However, Chinese heroism tends to collectivism(集体主义) and redeems(救赎) others by self sacrifice(自我牺牲). Secondly, American heroes have their own shortcomings. Before they succeed, they have to experience setbacks(挫折), while Chinese heroes are often perfect and have no shortcomings. They have lofty spiritual qualities(崇高的英雄品质). Finally, Chinese heroism and American heroism represent(代表) the cultural differences between China and the West. 

These are my different views on Chinese heroism and Western heroism

### 8. Do you think a university education can change a person’s life? In what way and why?

#### 你认为大学教育可以改变一个人的生活吗？以什么方式？为什么？

I think college education can change one's life. First of all, from high school to college, our learning style has big changes. From collective learning to individual learning. Secondly, we need to face life alone in college, and we need to be more independent. Finally, in the university, we will be constantly improved by the university education to better face our future work. To sum up, college education changes one's life through lifestyle.

### 9. What is the purpose of university education?

#### 大学教育的目的是什么？

I think the purposes of college education are as follows. First, improve your understanding of yourself. The importance of college education does not lie entirely in how much professional knowledge and technology students have learned, but more importantly, in making students learn to know themselves. Secondly, college education can enhance students' social morality. Let students contribute to society in the future. I think it is the real purpose of college education.

### 10. How can you make full use of your university life?

#### 如何充分利用大学生活？

In college life, we have enough time to learn things that we didn't have time to learn before. This can not only improve ourselves, but also enrich our college life. In college, we can do some part-time jobs to earn some money and do what we want to do. Even in college life, we can fall in love. To enrich your mind.
